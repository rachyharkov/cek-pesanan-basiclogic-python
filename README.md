# cek-pesanan-basiclogic-python
basic implementation of real life things that python can do (not much)

# So what is it all about?
it just a little project about using every posibility that python can do for support my learning process on python programming language, checking what user want (by asking them what kind of food, drink, and dessert on separate question) , then make sure the food, drink, and dessert they want is on the list, if it isn't on the list, the program will tell the user that the program don't have what user want, if the food or blablabla is on the list, the program will tell the user that the food, or blablabla is available

anyway, it's just a message showing after you're typing the answer lmao
